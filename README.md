# A Double Pendulum!

This repo hosts a custom RK4 solver, a 1st order system for the dynamics of the pendulum derived using the Lagrangian approach, and some visualization code to see the motion of the pendulum.  

## TODO: 
- Dervive the equations of motion via the [Udwadia-Kalaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udwadia%E2%80%93Kalaba_formulation) approach.
- Upload derivations of lagrange and UK approach
